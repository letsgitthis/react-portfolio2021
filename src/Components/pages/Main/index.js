              I was ready for a career change and made the decision to quit my
              job, sell my house, move back home to Austin, Texas and earn
              certifications to become a Web Developer/Software Engineer. My
              interest in coding started a long time ago when I was much younger
              and looking for a career path to persue, but I had unfortunately
              chosen a different path, life got in the way, and I wasn't in the
              right position to make any career changes. Eventually, I decided
              to start learning what I could on my own as a hobby in my spare
              time, until I hit a wall. I figured, just do what I'm most
              interest in and learn as I go, but found that for me to do those
              things, I needed to code. I had reached a point where if I wanted
              to go any further, I needed to be in a place where I could pursue
              it as more than just a hobby interest.

              Working full time as I was, I probably would've reached that next
              step in about... 10 years? Too slow. I had to do something if I
              wanted to reach that next step sooner. I set myself up to make
              some good financial decisions and was quickly able to freely
              choose what I wanted to do next in life. Over the last several
              years, I had began learning to use several Linux Distro's,
              familiarize myelf with the Bash terminal and repair broken
              computers for me to use. I figured, if I wanted to be in this
              field, I should be able to troubleshoot and repair my own
              computers. Every computer I currently own was either broken when I
              got it, or I built it from scratch. Then I earned a Full Stack
              certification from The Austin Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin. Now
              finally looking to apply what I have learned in a professional
              setting.
