# react-portfolio2021

This is the new repository for my Portfolio. Previous versions will not be updated. Link to web page will be provided on LinkedIn and Indeed once completed.

If I had known using different features of Materialize CSS in React was going to be this frustrating I would've used Sass.

Phase 1 ) Build Basic Portfolio that's styled

Phase 2 ) Build secondary routing to organize main focus projects from non-focus projects. You don't need to see all 40+ apps I've built, but I'll give you a neat and tidy option to look through everything.

Phase 3 ) Include video where I can give a quick overview of each project and how they work, problems I ran into, solutions, and what I would like to improve on.

Phase 4 ) Everything should be stored to a database and then called to the Portfolio. The Portfolio itself will have a main introduction video welcoming you explaining this, as well as a breif overview of how I structured everything.

None of these videos should exceed 5 minutes. Preferably they are just long enough to get the point across and then move on.
